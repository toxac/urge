# Ideas, Problems and Opportunities

- Customers don't care about your ideas, great innovations, visions and so on, they care about whether you can solve their problems.
- You need customers to have a business, else its all just a project
- You are going to have customer first approach
- some simple way to think about things when you go looking for ideas
  - Who are you selling to
  - What problem you're solving
  - Where they are?
- It's always good to start with what you know



## Opportunity Spotting

1. Look for something that has worked in one category and bring it to another category
2. Solve your own problem if you are willing to pay for it
3. Start with customers, Who do you have easy access to that you'd be excited to help



Focus on customers and which of their problems they are willing to pay for. Don't focus on yourself. If you get stuck on what you like to do you will be stuck in endless thinking,researching and not getting anywhere

Focus on making first sales
